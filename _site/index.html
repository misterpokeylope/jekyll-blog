        <h2>04 May 2014 &raquo; IT LIVES!</h2>
        <div class="post">
          <p>About four months ago we got fed up with how hit or miss the quality of the
wireless our WOW! provided router was, and replaced the wireless functions of
the offending Router/Modem abomination with a real wireless router. Somehow the
port forwarding and DHCP reservations for my Pi were disrupted, and
my website went down. Due to the business of this recent semester
at school I didn&#39;t have much time/energy (except I kinda did sometimes) to deal
with getting it back up and running. Now that I had a bit of free time between
Spring and Summer semester (almost an entire week!), I didn&#39;t have much of an
excuse to not deal with it.</p>

<p>Fortunately my four month out of date Arch Linux ARM install surved the most
massive system update it will hopefully ever have to deal with, and other
than not having enough space the first try due to an unemptied Pacman cache,
it&#39;s up and running, happy as can be.</p>

<p>Despite broken promises of real content and what not, I will still try to put
some stuff out every now and then, even though my next two semesters at school
are looking to be just as busy as my most recent ones.</p>

        <h2>02 Jan 2014 &raquo; New Year, Hopefully New Content</h2>
        <div class="post">
          <p>Hopefully in the coming year I am able/willing to make more posts with
content more interesting content than changes I made to the internals of this blog.
However, I&#39;ve reached a plateau in terms of changes I want to make, so there
isn&#39;t much more I can even post about it. Recently I&#39;ve embedded Mozilla&#39;s <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/Fira/">Fira
Typeface</a> in place of the user&#39;s predefined font. It should show up just
fine on Firefox and webkit browsers, but I have no idea about Internet Explorer other than IE11, 
or others. Just in case there are other pleasant fallbacks in place. The site may
load a bit slower now since it has to load the fonts, but it shouldn&#39;t be too
noticable.</p>

<p>The favicon is a new addition as well. It&#39;s nothing special, but the extremely
observant reader would have noticed that the letters &#39;m&#39; and &#39;p&#39; were made using
the Mr. Saturn font from the game Earthbound (a personal favorite of mine)!</p>

        <h2>16 Dec 2013 &raquo; New Name! Same Great Taste!</h2>
        <div class="post">
          <p>Earlier today I finally bit the proverbial bullet and purchased a domain for
this site. I now own the misterpokeylope.com domain, and will be using
it instead of the old mrpokeylope.mooo.com. I set up a redirect from the old 
URL to the new one and such, but at this point it&#39;s deprecated.</p>

<p>All of the dynamic DNS services are still provided by FreeDNS, and everything is
still hosted on my Raspberry Pi, so absolutely nothing has changed other than
the URL. Recently I discovered that my website could not be indexed by Google or
other search engines due to the polices of using a free shared subdomain from FreeDNS. 
So now, the hope is that people will actually be able to find this site 
without me having to give a link out...</p>

<p>$15 well spent I suppose.</p>

        <h2>12 Dec 2013 &raquo; Comments and Pagination</h2>
        <div class="post">
          <p>Now that I&#39;ve done further, most likely unnoticable, refinements to this site,
I have been tossing the idea around of adding a comments section to each of the
permalinked posts. There seem to be a fair number of static comment plugins
already available, so it sounds like it would be brain dead easy to add something
simple in. I&#39;m going to avoid complicated things like Disqus since it seems
like overkill for the &quot;whopping amount&quot; of traffic this website generates. I
will continue looking into more static solutions, since it would make it harder
for this place to just become a nest for spam bots.</p>

<p>In other news I&#39;ve implemented/fixed pagination for this site, using Jekyll&#39;s built in 
pagination. I&#39;ve technically had the code there the whole time, but since I had less than 
5 posts up until now, it didn&#39;t do anything. It was broken anyways due to <code>previous</code>
looking for <code>page1/</code>, which is not generated by my configuration. All that was
needed was an addition if-else clause with Liquid, and everything works as
intended. It&#39;s such a simple fix that I don&#39;t even know why Jekyll includes <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/#render_the_paginated_posts">the
broken example</a> on their page.</p>

<p>For the curious out there, here&#39;s my version:</p>

<p><code>index.html</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;pagination&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  {% if paginator.previous_page %}
    {% if paginator.previous_page == 1 %}
      <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Previous<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    {% else %}
      <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;page{{ paginator.previous_page }}&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Previous<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    {% endif %}
  {% else %}
    <span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>Previous<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  {% endif %}
  <span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>Page: {{ paginator.page }} of {{ paginator.total_pages }}<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  {% if paginator.next_page %}
    <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;page{{ paginator.next_page }}&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Next<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
  {% else %}
    <span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>Next<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  {% endif %}
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And that&#39;s really all it takes. I also tried the overly complicated fix they
have listed below, and fought with it far more than I should have (as in I had
to fight with it at all), and just settled on my slight modification instead.
Sure, I could have had links to multiple pages instead of just having &quot;next&quot;
and &quot;previous&quot;, but who cares? That&#39;s what the <a href="/archive">archives</a> are for!</p>

        <h2>06 Dec 2013 &raquo; Why Jekyll?</h2>
        <div class="post">
          <p>In my first post, I gave a couple of vague reasons why I decided to use Jekyll
to create this website, as opposed to something like Ruby on Rails. Having 
recently used Rails for a school project, I can understand the appeal of using such
a framework. It can be used to create powerful dynamic web apps with a range of
useful tools and features. But for what I wanted out of this website, Rails would 
be like bringing a nuclear missile to a water gun fight. It&#39;s simply offers far
more features than what I need. </p>

<p>Rails gives me the chance to build my own blog platform, while Jekyll <em>is</em> a 
blog platform, which allows me to focus on the blog itself, rather than writing 
and maintaining everything. While it would give me complete
control over every aspect of my website, I am simply not interested in this
level of control for such a small website. I feel comparing
Jekyll and Rails is not fair because they are just two  different
tools that both happen to be able to accomplish the same task. </p>

<p>Since I&#39;m far more interested in showing what I like about Jekyll than I am in 
comparing and contrasting Jekyll and Rails, I will keep the comparisons to a minimum. </p>

<p>Jekyll is as its website describes, &quot;a simple, blog-aware, static site
generator&quot;, nothing more, nothing less. Since it&#39;s just a ruby script, issuing 
a simple <code>gem install jekyll</code> in a terminal is all it takes to have everything 
installed, much like Rails. Again similar to Rails, one can then generate the
scaffolding for a new blog by issuing <code>jekyll new blog</code>.</p>

<p>This is where the two diverge however, with Jekyll taking a simpler path, as
far as blogs are concerned. Navigating into a newly generated blog directory 
gives a simple directory structure.</p>

<p><code>blog/</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">_layouts/
_posts/
_site/
css/
_config.yml
index.html
</code></pre></div>
<p>Even at first glance this structure is fairly simple to follow. Jekyll divides
sites into three main components, layouts, posts, and CSS. Since each of these
parts are constructed very differently from one another, it was a very sane
choice to give each their own directory. </p>

<p>This layout is very easy to extend as well. For example, if JavaScript is needed then all
that needs to be done is adding a <code>js/</code> directory to the root of the blog
directory, and it will be included in the final <code>_site/</code> folder after
generation.</p>

<p>Jekyll layouts use mainly HTML/CSS, spattered with <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers">Liquid Markup</a>
that gets interpreted to HTML at build-time. Again, if this sounds somewhat similar to
how Rails works, that&#39;s because it is.</p>

<p>A good example of how this works is the following:</p>

<p><code>_layouts/default.html</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>{{ page.title }}<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;nav&gt;</span>
      ...
    <span class="nt">&lt;/nav&gt;</span>
    {{ content }}
    <span class="nt">&lt;footer&gt;</span>
      ...
    <span class="nt">&lt;/footer&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then in <code>index.html</code> all that is needed is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html language-html" data-lang="html">---
layout: default
title: Home
---

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Look at this snazzy navbar and footer!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When <code>jekyll build</code> is run, the content of <code>index.html</code> will be combined with
<code>_layouts/default.html</code>, with the index content being placed in the <code>content</code> tag,
and the complete page(s), along with any CSS, will be placed in the <code>_sites/</code> directory. 
By just using the YAML front matter at the top of a page,
any page on the website can how have the navbar and footer, eliminating
redundancy or inconsistencies between creating multi-page websites. I found
this to be a very simple method to create consistency, while still maintaining
a certain level of control for each page.</p>

<p>Since a huge reason to use Jekyll is for the blog features, it helps that
creating blog posts is simple as well. Each blog post is written in markdown
and needs to be placed in the <code>_posts/</code> directory, with each following a naming
convention like <code>2013-12-6-why-jekyll.markdown</code>. Each post needs some YAML
front matter for Jekyll to construct everything properly, but the rest can be
written in pure markdown.</p>

<p><code>_posts/2013-12-6-why-jekyll.markdown</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">---
layout: default
title: &quot;Why Jekyll?&quot;
date: 2013-12-6
categories: posts
---

I dunno, _you_ tell me!
</code></pre></div>
<p>Jekyll makes it very simple to extend layouts for specific purposes, such as
dedicated pages for a post, using YAML front matter:</p>

<p><code>_layouts/post.html</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html language-html" data-lang="html">---
layout: default
---

<span class="nt">&lt;h2&gt;</span>{{ page.title }}<span class="nt">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;meta&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>{{ page.date | date_to_string }}<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

{{ content }}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now each dedicated post page can display the title and post date in a
header just by specifying the post layout in the YAML front matter.</p>

<p>Of course, Jekyll has even more to offer, like built in pagination, syntax
highlighting, and countless plugins, but I&#39;m not about to go on and on about it
for that long. Jekyll has so far been very pleasant to work with, and I can&#39;t
imagine switching to anything else any time soon.</p>
