    <p class="content">
      This website is developed during my free time, and to
      help with learning some material for a Web Applications Project
      class I took. I might also use it to host any other sort of projects
      in the future. However, it's still mainly a sandbox/toy to
      play with when I'm bored or have some free time and/or and
      a flimsy excuse to use my Raspberry Pi.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      Everything currently runs off a REV 2 Model B Raspberry Pi,
      running Arch Linux ARM. The web server software used is
      nginx, which I chose mainly for it's simplicity and low
      memory footprint. The dynamic DNS services are provided by Free
      DNS, since it's free to use and does not require free
      accounts to renew subscriptions every 30 days unlike
      certain other dynamic DNS providers.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p class="content">
      My goal is to keep this site fully HTML5 and CSS3
      compliant, as defined by the W3's markup validation
      services. That said, I also want to keep the design
      of this website simple. There are many neat and flashy
      effects that CSS3 can do, but being a fan of minimalism, 
      I will do my best to keep this site in line with
      what I believe to believe to be minimal and
      aesthetically pleasing.
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      As part of keeping everything minimalistic and this site
      being a learning opportunity, for now I plan to keep
      it static, using handwritten HTML and CSS. Using a web
      framework is slightly out of the scope of what I wanted
      for this website, but not out the question.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      The theme of the website is loosely inspired by that of
      the <a href="https://www.archlinux.org" target="_blank">
        Arch Linux</a> website, in term of clean design, and
      simple visual effects. The color scheme is derived from
      Google's Android Holo theme.
    </p>
    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Since this site is self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi sitting in
      my living room, I can make no guarantees about uptime or
      stability, be it system breaking Arch Linux ARM updates,
      WOW!'s somewhat iffy service, or roommates accidentally
      unplugging the Raspberry Pi...
