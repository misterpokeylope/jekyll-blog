  <div class="post">
    <p>Earlier today I finally bit the proverbial bullet and purchased a domain for
this site. I now own the misterpokeylope.com domain, and will be using
it instead of the old one. I will set up a redirect from the old one to the new
one and such, but at this point it&#39;s deprecated.</p>

<p>All of the dynamic DNS stuff is still provided by FreeDNS, and everything is
still hosted on my RaspberryPi, so absolutely nothing has changed other than
the URL. Before, I discovered that my website could not be indexed by Google or
other search engines due to the polices of using a shared subdomain. So now, the
hope is that people will actually be able to find this site, without me having
to give a link out...</p>

<p>$15 well spent I suppose.</p>

          CSS(3) vendor prefixes are used where available, with
