    <div class="post">
      <p>Now that I&#39;ve done further, most likely unnoticable, refinements to this site,
I have been tossing the idea around of adding a comments section to each of the
permalinked posts. There seem to be a fair number of static comment plugins
already available, so it sounds like it would be brain dead easy to add something
simple in. I&#39;m going to avoid complicated things like Disqus since it seems
like overkill for the &quot;whopping amount&quot; of traffic this website generates. I
will continue looking into more static solutions, since it would make it harder
for this place to just become a nest for spam bots.</p>

<p>In other news I&#39;ve implemented/fixed pagination for this site, using Jekyll&#39;s built in 
pagination. I&#39;ve technically had the code there the whole time, but since I had less than 
5 posts up until now, it didn&#39;t do anything. It was broken anyways due to <code>previous</code>
looking for <code>page1/</code>, which is not generated by my configuration. All that was
needed was an addition if-else clause with Liquid, and everything works as
intended. It&#39;s such a simple fix that I don&#39;t even know why Jekyll includes <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/#render_the_paginated_posts">the
broken example</a> on their page.</p>

<p>For the curious out there, here&#39;s my version:</p>

<p><code>index.html</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;pagination&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  {% if paginator.previous_page %}
    {% if paginator.previous_page == 1 %}
      <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Previous<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    {% else %}
      <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;page{{ paginator.previous_page }}&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Previous<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    {% endif %}
  {% else %}
    <span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>Previous<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  {% endif %}
  <span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>Page: {{ paginator.page }} of {{ paginator.total_pages }}<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  {% if paginator.next_page %}
    <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;page{{ paginator.next_page }}&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Next<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
  {% else %}
    <span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>Next<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  {% endif %}
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And that&#39;s really all it takes. I also tried the overly complicated fix they
have listed below, and fought with it far more than I should have (as in I had
to fight with it at all), and just settled on my slight modification instead.
Sure, I could have had links to multiple pages instead of just having &quot;next&quot;
and &quot;previous&quot;, but who cares? That&#39;s what the <a href="/archive">archives</a> are for!</p>
