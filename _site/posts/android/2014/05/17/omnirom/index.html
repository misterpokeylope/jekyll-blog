      <p>Like many other tech-competetent/masochistic Android users I enjoy using custom
Android ROMs on my devices. Although my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 10 were, and
would have continued to be, perfectly fine running stock Android I always found
it to be a bit lacking in a few areas, mainly in the customization department.</p>

<p>On my phone, I&#39;ve always used CyanogenMod due to the (percieved) stability and
fact that they still actively support the Sprint version of the Galaxy Nexus,
but I&#39;ve become warry of their direction after they went commercial. Unlike my 
phone, my Nexus 10 doesn&#39;t have any sort of critical functionality that 
could potentially be botched by bleeding edge ROMs. I&#39;ve tried the other two 
big players in the ROM market, but still didn&#39;t stick with them. While both are
great choices in their own right, I found Paranoid Android and AOKP to have 
<em>too many</em> features for my liking... </p>

<p>I like to have something closer to Stock, but without a huge amount of features 
I never use. I also tried the many offshoots of these three that frankenstein 
a bunch of features from all three, but encountered too many stability issues, 
or just too many unused features and component. Then while browsing the XDA 
Developers forums, I heard about a new player: <a href="http://omnirom.org/">OmniROM</a>.</p>

<p>OmniROM is developed by some of the bigger players in the Android development
community and in many ways it is has set out to accomplish what CyanogenMod 
is/used to be. Their goals include developing new open source software and 
enhancements for the wider Android community to benefit from, while providing
a simple, close to stock experience. The current nightlies are based on Android
4.4.2, and support a healthy and growing number of devices.</p>

<p>Thus far some of the more interesting features to the ROM include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Multiwindow</strong> (Still in development)</li>
<li><strong>OpenDelta:</strong> Over the air <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_update">delta updates</a></li>
<li><strong>OmniSwitch:</strong> A replacement for the standard Android App Switcher, with more 
features, and a favorites list for Apps.</li>
<li><strong>Active Display:</strong> Displays notifications on the screen, when it is off.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/omniswitch-thumb.png" alt="omniswitch"></p>

<p>There&#39;s many smaller features such as being able to change the placement of the
clock, or being able to adjust the size of the soft buttons, and a home-grown 
file manager. However, one of the aspects I value most of this ROM is their 
stance on Nightly Releases.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">We also recognise how people use Custom ROMs – we’re all custom ROM users and
developers ourselves – the argument that “nightlies are not for end users” is
over-used, and no longer valid. We’ve found that the vast majority of users
want to get nightly updates to their ROM. For that reason, nightlies aren’t a
playground – nightlies are for new features that are finished. You should be
able to expect the same stability and reliability from a nightly as you would
from a “release” ROM, and can report any bugs that prevent this from happening.
</code></pre></div>
<p>-(<a href="http://omnirom.org/about/">About Omni</a>)</p>

<p>And in the six or so months that I have been using Omni I have found this to be
incredibly true. I&#39;ve yet to encounter any serious crash or instability while
on any of the nightlies, which were all installed with OpenDelta. While I quite
often have issues with OpenDelta stopping in the middle of downloading updates,
It&#39;s always produced working updates, despite somewhat enlongated waiting. A
word of warning however is that OpenDelta currently only supports TWRP
recovery at this moment, since cwm doesn&#39;t officially support the scripting 
that OpenDelta requires.</p>

<p><img src="/img/opendelta-thumb.png" alt="opendelta"></p>

<p>That said, OmniROM is still very much a work in progress and currently does not
have a &quot;stable&quot; release. Despite the relative stability of the nightlies, some
users may not be comfortable using it until a stable release has been made. But
for those who are feeling slightly adventurous, I would wholeheartedly
recommend giving OmniROM a shot, especially to those who are not completely
happy with their current ROM. If nothing else, OmniROM has a ton of potential
that is very quickly being recognized with their fast and stable releases.</p>
