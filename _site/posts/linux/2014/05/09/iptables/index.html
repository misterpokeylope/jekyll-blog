    <div class="post">
      <p>With the recent fixing of my &quot;network issues&quot;, I have been putting more time
and effort in to making sure everything, from the website to the Raspberry Pi,
is cleaned out after it&#39;s Winter hibernation. Upon reading some of journald&#39;s
log files (which I&#39;d noticed grew somewhat quickly), I discovered a flood of
failed remote login attempts, clustered at different times of the day, and all
attempting to login from high numbered ports, with users that don&#39;t exist on the
system. A quick <code>whois</code> lookup on the IPs revealed that they&#39;re locations from 
all over the world, so most likely bots looking for easy access to insecure 
systems.</p>

<p>Before the downtime I had not bothered to setup any sort of protection on the
Pi since I figured that my domain was still relatively new and unknown. While
it&#39;s still pretty unkown, I have it posted in public places now, and have it
indexed by Google, so this most likely allows intrepid spam-bots to find my
domain relatively easily. While programs like <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">fail2ban</a> or disabling
ssh all together could have remedied the problem, I went for a much less
passive approach, and decided to set up a firewall.</p>

<p>Linux has plenty of software firewall solutions, but naturally I decided to go 
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables">iptables</a>, the Linux kernel&#39;s built-in firewall. I&#39;m fully
aware of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nftables">nftables</a>, the sucessor to iptables, but since Arch Linux
ARM currently has the 3.10 Kernel as it&#39;s &quot;stable&quot; Kernel version this option 
is not available to me yet. I plan on using it however, once it fully 
replaces iptables in the kernel.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s a powerful tool, iptables is not the easiest to setup for those
inexperienced with firewalls, like me. Fortunately the fantastic Arch Wiki has
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Simple_stateful_firewall">an entire article for setting up a stateful firewall</a> with iptables. </p>

<p>Admittedly it didn&#39;t go as smoothly as I thought it would, entirely due to
PEBKAC issues, and setting it up over an ssh connection. As one could
imagine setting the <code>INPUT DROP</code> policy before configuring the SSH
related chain will quickly lead to an unproductive session, especially when one
doesn&#39;t have immediate physical access to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Luckily for me the article in question has a helpful explination of what each
command did at each step, so at least I wouldn&#39;t feel too bad about the fact 
I mainly copy and pasted the commands that I felt I needed. While I still don&#39;t
know a significant amount about iptables yet, I feel I now at least have a 
basic understanding, that suits a machine that only servers out a simple 
webserver.</p>

<p>For those interested, I threw together a quick bash script that more or less 
matches the rules and chains I have in place. This must be run as root, so 
<em>use with caution</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, there is more I need to do, such as disabling logins for SSH, and only
allowing access via SSH keys. That being said, there&#39;s nothing particularly
interesting/useful/valuable on my Raspberry Pi in the first place.</p>
