      <p>
        This website is developed during my free time, and
        helped with learning some material for a Web Applications Project
        course I took while in school. I might also use it to host any other 
        sort of projects in the future. However, it's still mainly a sandbox/toy 
        to play with when I'm bored or have some free time. I mainly use it to 
        write musings related to Linux and other tech experiences.

        Intially this website was hosted on a REV 2 Model B Raspberry Pi,
        running Arch Linux ARM and an nginx HTTP server, which I chose mainly 
        for it's simplicity and low memory footprint. The website  is now 
        hosted by GitHub Pages for it's ease of maintaining and for consistent 
        uptime. The dynamic DNS services are provided by FreeDNS, since it does
        not require free accounts to renew subscriptions regularly.

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <p>
        My goal is to keep this site fully HTML5 and CSS3 compliant, as defined
        by the W3's markup validation services. I also want to keep  the design 
        of this website simple. There are many neat and flashy effects that 
        CSS3can do, but being a fan of minimalism, I will do my best to keep 
        this site in line with what I believe to believe to be minimal and 
        aesthetically pleasing. As part of keeping everything minimalistic and 
        this site being a learning opportunity, for now I plan to keep it 
        static, using mostly handwritten HTML and CSS.

      <p>
        The theme of the website is loosely inspired by that of the 
        <a href="https://www.archlinux.org"> Arch Linux</a> 
        website, in term of clean design, and simple visual effects. The color 
        scheme is derived from Google's Android Holo theme.
