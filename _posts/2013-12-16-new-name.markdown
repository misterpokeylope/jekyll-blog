Earlier today I finally bit the proverbial bullet and purchased a domain for
this site. I now own the misterpokeylope.com domain, and will be using
it instead of the old one. I will set up a redirect from the old one to the new
one and such, but at this point it's deprecated.

All of the dynamic DNS stuff is still provided by FreeDNS, and everything is
still hosted on my Raspberry Pi, so absolutely nothing has changed other than
the URL. Recently I discovered that my website could not be indexed by Google or
other search engines due to the polices of using a free shared subdomain from FreeDNS. 
So now, the hope is that people will actually be able to find this site 
without me having to give a link out...

$15 well spent I suppose.
