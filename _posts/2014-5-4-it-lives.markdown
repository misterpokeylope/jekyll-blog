About four months ago we got fed up with how hit or miss
our WOW! provided router was, and replaced the wireless functions of
the offending Router/Modem abomination with a real wireless router. Somehow the
port forwarding and DHCP reservations for my Pi were disrupted, and
my website went down. Due to how busy this recent semester
at school was, I didn't have much time/energy (except I kinda did sometimes) to deal
with getting it back up and running. Since I had a bit of free time between
Spring and Summer semester (almost an entire week!), I didn't have much of an
excuse to not deal with it.

Fortunately my four-month-out-of-date Arch Linux ARM install survived the most
massive system update it will hopefully ever have to deal with, and other
than not having enough space the first try due to an unemptied Pacman cache,
it's up and running, happy as can be.

Despite broken promises of real content and what not, I will still try to put
some stuff out every now and then, even though my final two semesters at school
are looking to be just as busy as my most recent ones.
