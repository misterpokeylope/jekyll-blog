Hopefully in the coming year I am able/willing to make more posts with
content more interesting content than changes I made to the internals of this blog.
However, I've reached a plateau in terms of changes I want to make, so there
isn't much more I can even post about it. Recently I've embedded Mozilla's [Fira
Typeface][fira] in place of the user's predefined font. It should show up just
fine on Firefox and webkit browsers, but I have no idea about Internet Explorer other than IE11, 
or others. Just in case there are other pleasant fallbacks in place. The site may
load a bit slower now since it has to load the fonts, but it shouldn't be too
noticable.

The favicon is a new addition as well. It's nothing special, but the extremely
observant reader would have noticed that the letters 'm' and 'p' were made using
the Mr. Saturn font from the game Earthbound (a personal favorite of mine)!
