What's that sound? That's the sound of backpedaling! I've decided to add a 
commenting system for any lost souls who find this place and for some reason 
want to leave a comment. The section can be found in the permalink at the 
bottom of a post, or by navigating to a post from the archive.

Instead of Disqus, I found a different service called [muut][muut], that 
provides a similar service of embeddable comment sections, via javascript. 
While Disqus is much more ubiquitous, muut looks and feels much cleaner on my 
pages, and doesn't crowd up my code as much as Disqus does. Muut also has other 
neat (but unnecessary) features like real time commenting and a universal 
comment feed for moderation, but as a plus they do seem fairly commited to 
user privacy.

Feel free to leave a comment, so that I know everything works! Or that 
anyone actually reads any of these posts.
