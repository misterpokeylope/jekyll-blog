Over the past few days, as probably nobody noticed, the website was
inaccessible. I'm thinking it started partly due to me accidentally changing some
of my port forwarding settings, along with WOW!'s general suckiness, and some
other issue with my Raspberry Pi. 

Whatever the issue was, I finally got around
to rebooting the Raspberry Pi, and everything seems to be working again. Such a
Windows-style solution!
