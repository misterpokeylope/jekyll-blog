Like many other tech-competetent/masochistic Android users I enjoy using custom Android
ROMs on my devices. Although my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 10 were, and
would have continued to be, perfectly fine running stock Android I always found
it to be a bit lacking in a few areas, mainly in the customization department.

On my phone, I've always used CyanogenMod due to the (percieved) stability and
fact that they still actively support the Sprint version of the Galaxy Nexus,
but I've become warry of their direction after they went commercial. Unlike my 
phone, my Nexus 10 doesn't have any sort of critical functionality that 
could potentially be botched by bleeding edge ROMs. I've tried the other two 
big players in the ROM market, but still didn't stick with them. While both are
great choices in their own right, I found Paranoid Android and AOKP to have *too many*
features for my liking... 

I like to have something closer to Stock, but without a huge amount of features 
I never use. I also tried the many offshoots of these three that frankenstein 
a bunch of features from all three, but encountered too many stability issues, 
or just too many unused features and component. Then while browsing the XDA 
Developers forums, I heard about a new player: [OmniROM][omni].
